"""Abstract ``ThreadMessageStore`` — the conversation transcript mirror (IA M4).

Message history lives in LangGraph's ``checkpoints`` blob (no SQL pushdown,
no tenant RLS). The ``TranscriptMirrorSweep`` copies user/assistant text
turns into ``thread_message`` so the conversation browser's content search
runs as an indexed, RLS-scoped query.

Implementations:
- :class:`expert_work.persistence.thread_message.memory.InMemoryThreadMessageStore`
- :class:`expert_work.persistence.thread_message.sql.SqlThreadMessageStore`
