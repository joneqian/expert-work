"""Detect: a non-bypass session with no tenant context is logged (Phase 1).

RLS is currently inert at runtime (the app connects as a DB superuser);
before enforcement lands (a later task adds ``SET LOCAL ROLE app_user``),
this pins the Phase-1 **Detect** signal: ``_rls_after_begin`` logs a
structured ``rls.would_fail_closed`` WARNING whenever a session is
neither bypassed nor tenant-scoped. Under future enforcement that
session would fail closed (zero rows) — the warning surfaces every such
path so it can be fixed before cutover. No behaviour change here.

This exercises the listener directly with a stub connection, in the same
style as ``test_rls_unit.py`` — no database needed. (The task brief's
sketch used ``sqlite+aiosqlite``, but ``aiosqlite`` is not a dependency
of this repo — confirmed absent from ``pyproject.toml``/``uv.lock``.)
