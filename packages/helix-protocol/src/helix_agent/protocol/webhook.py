"""HX-9 租户级出站 webhook hook — DTOs.

STREAM-HX-DESIGN § 13 (Mini-ADR HX-J0~J5). The platform signs and POSTs
agent-lifecycle events to a tenant-registered URL — the outbound dual of
the J.10 inbound triggers.

These DTOs are the wire shape between the webhook CRUD API
(:class:`WebhookEndpointSpec` is the create payload), the stores (rows are
:class:`WebhookEndpointRecord` / :class:`WebhookDeliveryRecord`), and the
delivery worker.
