"""Run lifecycle registry — in-memory :class:`RunManager` + durable :class:`RunStore`.

Algorithm pattern borrowed from bytedance/deer-flow runtime/runs/* @
``813d3c94``. ``RunManager`` stays in-memory (per-process registry +
5-minute TTL); Mini-ADR J-41 adds the durable ``agent_run`` table
behind :class:`RunStore` so a run's status survives the TTL sweep and
control-plane restarts. Run queueing / retry / DLQ remain J.10 work.
