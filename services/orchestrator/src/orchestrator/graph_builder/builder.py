"""ReAct graph builder — Stream E.6 + E.12.5.

Builds a LangGraph :class:`StateGraph` that implements single-agent
ReAct over :class:`orchestrator.state.AgentState`. The graph has two
nodes wired by a single conditional edge:

::

    START → agent ↔ tools → END
              │
              └─ END (when LLM stops issuing tool_calls or max_steps hit)

The **agent** node delegates the LLM call to an injected
:class:`LLMCaller` (E.11 :class:`LLMRouter` in prod; deterministic fake
in tests) and bumps ``step_count`` by one before returning. Entering with
``step_count >= max_steps`` does NOT fail the run: it degrades gracefully to
one final tool-less "wrap up with what you have" turn (hermes-agent #7915),
preserving work the run already produced. (:class:`MaxStepsExceededError`
remains a defensive safety net consumed by the SSE runner + child-run path.)

The **tools** node walks the most-recent ``AIMessage.tool_calls``,
dispatches each through :class:`ToolRegistry`, and appends one
``ToolMessage`` per call to the messages list. Any uncaught tool
exception (including ``ToolNotFoundError`` for unknown names) is
wrapped into ``ToolMessage(content="[tool error] ...")`` rather than
re-raised, per Mini-ADR E-12 — the LLM sees the error as a tool result
and reasons about retry / different args / final answer.

Stream E.12.5 wires the middleware chain into both nodes. Anchor calls
(only when the corresponding chain is passed; ``None`` → no-op):

- ``before_llm_call`` chain → ``agent_node`` invokes before the LLM
  call. ``ctx.payload`` carries ``messages`` / ``tools`` / ``tenant_id``;
  middlewares (E.3 dynamic_context, E.5 pii_redact) may rewrite the
  messages, and E.13 ``cache_lookup`` may set ``llm_cache_hit`` to a
  cached :class:`AIMessage` — when present, ``agent_node`` skips the
  LLM call entirely.
- ``around_llm_call`` chain → handed to :class:`LLMRouter` which
  invokes the chain **per provider** (Mini-ADR E-13), so each
  fallback attempt gets its own E.4 breaker + E.5 langfuse span.
- ``after_llm_call`` chain → ``agent_node`` invokes after the LLM
  returns (or after a cache hit). ``ctx.payload`` carries ``response``
  (mutable) + ``messages`` (running history) + ``prompt_messages``
  (the exact prompt, for E.13 cache-key derivation) + ``tenant_id`` +
  ``cache_hit`` (bool — E.13 ``cache_store`` skips storing a turn that
  was itself served from cache). Middlewares (E.10.5 loop_detection)
  may rewrite the response or append reminder messages.
- ``before_tool_dispatch`` chain → ``tools_node`` invokes per
  ``tool_call``. ``ctx.payload`` carries ``tool_name`` + ``tool_args``;
  a pre-dispatch middleware may raise to block the dispatch.

Stream RT-1 PR-3 (RT-ADR-4): a terminal turn under a Tier3
``output_schema`` may issue ONE schema-enforced resend when the free
candidate does not validate. That resend gets its own before/after
anchor pass with the :class:`StructuredOutputSpec` instance in
``payload["output_schema"]`` (design § 7.4 — the E.13 schema
fingerprint), so on such a turn each anchor fires once per real LLM
call: primary + resend.

        #    path invisible here), so per-path special-casing has no sound
        #    input at this layer.
        #  * A terminal candidate is validated locally first — a conforming
        #    reply costs zero extra calls.

    Two trigger paths:

    1. **``full_content`` set** (bash / exec_python / http / mcp) — the tool
       already truncated ``content``; save the full rendering, keep the

       ``EXTERNALIZE_MIN_CHARS`` (e.g. ``web_search``). Save the content,
       replace the body with a head+tail preview, append the reference. This is
       what keeps many medium results (8x web_search) from accumulating into a
       context blowup.

    Best-effort (Mini-ADR CM-F5): a write failure never affects the run — the
    ``full_content`` path keeps the already-truncated body; the generalized path
    degrades to in-place head+tail truncation so context is still bounded.
