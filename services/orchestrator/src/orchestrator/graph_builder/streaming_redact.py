"""Buffered-release streaming redaction for token SSE frames (流式 epic 子项目 2).

Token deltas escape the LLM router BEFORE the node-level output guards run on the
assembled message, so a per-delta redaction pass runs here as defense in depth.
Reuses the SAME regex guards as the non-streaming path (``scan_and_redact`` for
DLP, ``screen_output`` for the credential/exfil screen), applied incrementally
with a look-back hold so a pattern split across deltas is never partially emitted.

Token frames are provisional: the authoritative ``updates`` frame (full guards on
the complete message) is the source of truth. This redactor is best-effort on the
preview — the fixed-shape DLP patterns (card/id/phone) fit fully inside the hold
window; anything longer is covered by the authoritative frame. The residual case
is email: the pattern is unbounded, so an address longer than HOLD_CHARS can still
leak a partial head in the provisional preview — the authoritative frame is the
backstop for that case.

#:      escape before the screen latch trips.
#:   2. >= every fixed-shape DLP (``scan_and_redact``) pattern's MAXIMUM
#:      match length, so a pattern still completing is always still inside
#:      the hold and never partially redacted.
#: Holds today: screen minimums top out at 39 (Google API key `AIza…{35}`;
#: sk-…{20,}=23, AKIA…=20, xox…=15, PEM=27); DLP fixed-shape maxes top out at

#: Target lag of the frozen pointer behind the buffer end (and thus the size of
#: the suffix rescanned by DLP each feed). Governs per-feed rescan cost, not
#: correctness: bounded-equivalence is upheld by the exact split-equality check
#: in ``_advance_frozen``, and the screen latch by scanning the full unfrozen
#: tail (``_buf[_frozen_raw:]``) — a credential's minimum match (<= 39) is fully
#: inside that tail the feed it completes, because HOLD_CHARS (64) > 39 keeps
#: _frozen_raw behind the credential's start until it is caught and latched.
