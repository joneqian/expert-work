"""Canonical LangGraph state shape for orchestrator graphs.

Per [STREAM-E-DESIGN § 2.3](../../../../docs/streams/STREAM-E-DESIGN.md),
fields are added incrementally across the Stream E sub-PRs:

- **E.1**: ``messages`` (LangGraph reducer-style append)
- **E.6**: ``step_count`` + ``max_steps`` for the ReAct loop guard

Every ``AgentState`` channel is checkpointed (dill), so **non-serialisable
runtime objects do not live here**. They travel via the
``config["configurable"]`` channel instead — it is per-invocation and not
checkpointed:

- Tenant binding (``tenant_id`` / ``session_id`` / ``run_id``) — LangGraph idiom.
- ``cancellation_token`` (E.15) — backed by a live ``asyncio.Event``.
- The ``LLMRouter`` holds its own provider chain + fallback state (E.11).

    keeping a stable order (``existing`` first, then names from ``new`` not

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """State threaded through every orchestrator LangGraph node.

    ``messages`` uses LangGraph's ``add_messages`` reducer so nodes
    returning ``{"messages": [...]}`` append to (rather than overwrite)
    the conversation history. ``step_count`` and ``max_steps`` use the
    default overwrite reducer — the agent node sets the new count each
    turn, and ``max_steps`` is configured once at graph construction.

    ``plan`` (Stream J.1) is set once by the ``planner`` node when the
    manifest's ``workflow.type`` is ``plan_execute``; it is absent for
    plain ``react`` graphs. ``NotRequired`` so the ReAct input shape is
    unchanged — readers use ``state.get("plan")``.

    ``reflections`` (Stream J.2) accumulates one :class:`Reflection` per
    ``reflect`` node entry — an ``operator.add`` reducer appends. Absent
    unless the manifest carries a ``reflection:`` block.

    ``recalled_memories`` (Stream J.3) is set once by the ``memory_recall``
    node — the long-term memories ``agent_node`` renders into its system
    context. Absent unless the manifest enables long-term memory.

    ``step_count_refund_pending`` (Stream L.L5 / Mini-ADR L-5) is the
    narrow channel a ``tools_node`` writes when one or more tools
    returned :attr:`~orchestrator.tools.registry.ToolResult.refund_iterations`
    greater than zero. The next ``agent_node`` subtracts it from
    ``step_count`` (clamped at 0) before computing the post-turn count,
    then resets the channel to ``0``. Keeps refund accounting
    observable and auditable instead of letting tools rewrite
    ``step_count`` directly.

    ``tool_failures`` (Stream CM-1, generalising L.L4) accumulates
    :class:`~orchestrator.tools.error_classifier.ClassifiedToolError`
    rows for tool calls that failed in the most recent ``tools`` batch —
    both error-path failures (classified at the catch site from the real
    exception) and the success-path ``mutation_not_landed`` case folded
    in from L-4's mutation classifier. The next ``agent_node`` reads the
    list, emits a ``<recovery-advisory>`` ``HumanMessage`` with grounded
    per-tool recovery guidance, and resets the channel to ``[]``.
    Defaults to empty; tools_node only writes when at least one tool
    failed.

    ``subagent_invocations`` (Stream J.4-补强-2 / Mini-ADR J-40)
    accumulates one
    :class:`~expert_work.protocol.subagent.SubAgentInvocation` per
    SubAgentTool delegation — every outcome path (success / max_steps /
    cancelled / future timed_out) appends a terminal-state row via the
    ``operator.add`` reducer. Lets the parent's LangGraph checkpoint
    carry the full delegation history (audit + J.13 eval replay), and
    feeds future M2-B fan-in aggregation (iteration_used sum /
    llm_call_count sum / wall_clock_ms max). Absent unless the manifest
    declares ``subagents``.

    ``pending_approval`` (Stream J.8 / Mini-ADR J-24) carries the
    :class:`~expert_work.protocol.approval.ApprovalRequest` a run is
    paused on — ``tools_node`` writes it before the run routes to END
    (RunStatus.PAUSED). The overwrite reducer applies: a resume clears
    it back to ``None``. Absent on a run that has never paused.

    ``approval_resume`` (Stream J.8-step3b) is the transient channel the
    resume endpoint writes via ``aupdate_state`` — a
    ``{"decision", "modified_args"}`` dict. ``tools_node`` reads it on
    re-entry to apply the human verdict (approve dispatches the gated
    tool_call, modify rewrites its args, reject synthesises a rejection
    ``ToolMessage``) and clears it back to ``None``.

    ``approval_outcome`` (Stream J.8-step3b) is the terminal signal a
    declarative-gate *reject* sets — ``_after_tools`` routes the run to
    END when it is ``"rejected"`` (the platform vetoed the run). An
    agent-initiated ``ask_for_approval`` reject leaves it unset so the
    run loops back to the agent.

    ``promoted_tools`` (Stream TE-6) carries the names of deferred tools
    the ``find_tools`` meta-tool has retrieved this run. ``find_tools``
    writes via :attr:`ToolResult.state_updates`; the ``_merge_promoted``
    reducer union-dedupes across turns. The next ``agent_node`` adds the
    matching deferred specs to the LLM bind so the promoted tools become
    callable. Per-thread + checkpointed, so promotion stays isolated to
    the run and never mutates the cached registry. Absent (treated as ``[]``)
    until ``find_tools`` first promotes — zero behaviour change when no
    tool is deferred.

    ``last_projection_hash`` (Stream CM-0 / Mini-ADR CM-A3) is the content
    digest of the most recent ``DB → /workspace`` projection (PLAN.md /
    TODO.md / MEMORY.md). ``tools_node`` passes it to the
    :class:`~orchestrator.context.WorkspaceProjector` as the only-if-changed
    baseline and writes the new digest back, so an unchanged turn skips the
    sandbox round-trip. Absent until the first projection; ``None`` means
    nothing has been projected yet.
