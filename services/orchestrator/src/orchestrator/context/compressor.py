"""Stream L.L2 — :class:`ContextCompressor` + token preflight.

Implements Hermes ``context_compressor.py:454-600``'s "summarise the
middle" pattern, scoped down to a single-pass-per-turn API. The
:func:`agent_node` preflight calls :func:`ContextCompressor.compress`
when the estimated outbound prompt size exceeds
``context_window * threshold_pct``; the compressor preserves the
first ``head_keep`` and last ``tail_keep`` non-system messages and
collapses the middle into a single ``<context-summary>`` system
message generated via an LLM call.

Mini-ADR L-2 highlights:

* **One-shot per turn** — we don't keep a running summary across
  compressions (Hermes "iterative summary preservation"). Each
  compression starts fresh from the current message list; if the
  conversation grows large enough to need compression repeatedly the
  individual passes are cheap, and the result is easier to reason
  about than a self-feeding summary.
* **Independent summariser LLM call** — the compressor takes its own
  :class:`LLMCaller`. The agent's main router may go through the
  same caller, but the contract is "summarise this, return one
  message" rather than "act as the agent" so a future hop to a
  dedicated cheaper model is a one-field change.
* **Hard cap via ``max_passes``** — if successive summarisations
  cannot bring the estimated size below threshold the compressor
  raises :class:`ContextOverflowError`. Hiding the failure behind a
  silent fallback would let the run keep ballooning until the
  upstream rejects it; the explicit signal lets the orchestrator log
  a clean run-failed audit.
* **Transient summariser failure skips, not fails (RT-ADR-6)** — a
  summariser LLM exception no longer fails the run on the spot: the
  round returns the messages uncompressed (metric + warning log) and
  the next turn retries. Only ``_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_SUMMARY_FAILURES``
  consecutive failed rounds of the SAME conversation (the streak is
  keyed by the caller-supplied ``streak_key`` — thread_id — because a
  compressor instance is shared across conversations) escalate to
  :class:`ContextOverflowError`; an empty middle that is still over
  threshold stays fail-hard (nothing left to summarise).
* **Summariser prompt budget (RT-ADR-10)** — the transcript handed to
  the summariser is itself bounded: a per-message char cap plus a
  total hard budget (halved between PREVIOUS SUMMARY and NEW EVENTS
  in update mode), so a single oversized tool dump cannot blow up the
  summariser call. Truncation keeps the head (2/3) and tail of each
  slice around a visible elision marker (deer-flow #3887
  ``_bound_text`` shape).
* **Skill reads become references (RT-ADR-7)** — a successful
  lazy-skill read (``ToolMessage(name="skill_view")``) in the middle
  enters the summariser transcript as a one-line skill reference
  (name + source path, no tool-call syntax — the summariser prompt
  forbids it in the output) instead of its up-to-20k body: the
  summary keeps the skill NAME while the input budget is spent on
  the actual conversation; the re-read handle itself is provided by
  the available-skills list in the system prompt and the CM-12
  pruner stub.
* **Rough char-based estimator** — ``estimate_tokens`` returns
  ``total_chars // 4``. Cheaper than tiktoken (no dependency, no
  per-message tokeniser call) and Hermes uses the same rule of
  thumb. The 4-chars-per-token heuristic is conservative for English
  / code, slightly aggressive for CJK; the threshold ratio gives us
  enough headroom to absorb the difference without ratcheting up
  cost.

        unrelated runs' failures (see :class:`_FailureStreaks`). With
        ``streak_key=None`` a transient failure keeps the skip-once
        semantics but is NOT counted toward escalation — without a
        conversation identity, counting on the shared instance would
        reintroduce exactly the cross-conversation false-failure the
        key exists to prevent. The empty-middle / max_passes fail-hard
        paths are unaffected by the key.

        Stream CM-3 — ``on_pre_compaction`` (when supplied) is awaited with
        the middle slice each pass is about to discard, *before* it is
        summarised away, so the caller can flush it to durable memory. It
        is best-effort by contract: the caller must swallow its own
        non-cancellation failures; a :class:`RunCancelledError` raised by
        the hook propagates out and aborts the run.

        Stream RT-2 PR-4 — ``on_compacted`` (when supplied) is awaited ONCE
        per call that actually produced a summary, with the run's
        :class:`CompactionStats` (a skip-only round or an entry already
        under threshold emits nothing). Best-effort by the same contract as
        ``on_pre_compaction``: the caller swallows its own failures.
