"""``update_plan`` tool — Stream K.K8.

When the manifest's ``workflow.type`` is ``plan_execute`` the
``planner`` node (Stream J.1) writes an initial :class:`Plan` into
``AgentState`` once at the start of the run; ``agent_node`` then
renders that plan into the system context every step. Without an
in-run mutation entry the agent has no way to revise the plan when
execution diverges from it — STREAM-K-DESIGN § 3.K8 calls this the
"plan_execute closure gap".

This tool is the closure: the agent can call ``update_plan`` with a
fresh ordered list of steps; the tools node promotes the new
:class:`Plan` onto ``AgentState.plan`` via the
:data:`~orchestrator.tools.registry.TOOL_ALLOWED_STATE_KEYS` channel.
The reflect node's existing ``revise`` path (Stream J.2) already
covers reflective replans; ``update_plan`` adds the agent-initiated
path.

The tool is implicit — never declared in the manifest. Since P3 the
factory registers it for **every** agent (not just ``plan_execute``):
a react-mode agent calls it to *create* a plan on demand, a
plan_execute agent's planner node seeds an initial plan that this tool
then *replaces*.
