"""``/v1/platform/judge-config`` — platform output/action judge model (Stream PI-3-A1).

system_admin-only view + write of the EFFECTIVE platform **judge** model: the
model used by the PI-2b output judge and the PI-3b action judge. Unset is a
valid state — the judge then falls back to each agent's own primary model.

Gating mirrors :mod:`control_plane.api.platform_embedding_config`: ``principal``
arrives via the shared ``_principal`` dependency, handlers gate on
``principal.is_system_admin``, responses use the ``{success,data,error}`` envelope.
