"""Postgres advisory-lock :class:`WorkspaceLock` — Stream TE-8.

The orchestrator tool layer declares the :class:`WorkspaceLock` Protocol and
defaults to a no-op; the control plane owns the database engine, so the real
cross-replica implementation lives here.

:class:`PgWorkspaceLock` holds ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` keyed on the
workspace identity (``{tenant}:{user}``) for the duration of a write, so
``write_file`` / ``bash`` writes to one user's workspace serialise across
orchestrator replicas (TE-ADR-3). It uses the *transaction*-scoped advisory
lock (auto-released at commit/rollback) — never the session-scoped variant,
which leaks under PgBouncer transaction mode (``infra/README.md`` § Postgres).

It borrows the xact-lock + ``hashtextextended`` technique from
:func:`expert_work.runtime.event_log.db._acquire_thread_lock`, but with two
deliberate differences the technique alone doesn't cover:

- **The lock is held across a long external exec** (the sandbox write, up to
  bash's 300 s). The transaction therefore sits *idle-in-transaction* for
  that whole window, so the per-database short-DML timeout defaults
  (``idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`` / ``statement_timeout``) would
  otherwise terminate the txn mid-write — releasing the advisory lock early
  and breaking cross-replica exclusion. We raise both via ``SET LOCAL``
  (txn-scoped, auto-reverted, safe under PgBouncer transaction mode) above
  the max write duration. The event-log precedent doesn't need this because
  its txn is millisecond-short.
- **Its own advisory key space.** event_log uses the single-arg 64-bit
  ``pg_advisory_xact_lock(bigint)`` space; this uses the *two-arg*
  ``pg_advisory_xact_lock(int4, int4)`` space — a structurally separate key
  space in Postgres — so a workspace key can never collide with a thread key.

The lock is taken on a *raw* (non-RLS) session: it never reads a
tenant-scoped table, so it needs no tenant role / RLS context. Tenant
isolation comes from the ``{tenant}:{user}`` key itself.
