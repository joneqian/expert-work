"""Production quality judge — Stream RT-5 (RT-ADR-23).

LLM-as-judge scoring for sampled production runs. Uses the RT-1 structured
output path directly (``build_llm_router`` + ``output_schema``): the verdict
is a schema-validated JSON object, never a regex-scraped integer. Credentials
are platform-exclusive (BYOK was removed in Stream Y-1), resolved through
``CredentialsResolver.resolve_provider`` and pinned into the ``ModelSpec`` —
the same path the eval agent / embedder / defense judge use.

Deliberately self-contained (surgical): it builds its own thin caller from
the shared router primitives rather than importing the ``Consolidator*``-named
aux adapter, so the memory-consolidation critical path is untouched.

Honest boundary (RT-ADR-23): the score is a subjective rubric verdict, not
ground truth. ``addressed_request`` measures relevance / completeness, *not*
factual correctness — the platform is domain-agnostic and cannot verify truth.
